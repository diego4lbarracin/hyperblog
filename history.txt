Hi, my name is Diego

I'm 17. Actually, I'm almost 18, oh, and I forgot to mention that I was in Colombia,
more specifically, in a small town in a department of my country that is mostly rural.

I managed to get an scholar ship to go to the university for free. 
Now I study in one of the best universities of my country, "Pontificia Universidad Javerian"
It hasn't been easy, but I'm extremly happy :)

People think I'm smart, but I don't think I'm 
smart at all.

I'm a Spanish native speaker, but I also speak English fluently.

Nothing else to say. Let's see when I'll edit this text again :D.

Making changes. Only for experimental purposes.

Today, I think my English is better, I'm not getting confused too often.
Besides, I'm not missing to many words aswell.
